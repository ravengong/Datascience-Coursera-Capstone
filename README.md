# Introduction

This repository consist of artifacts related to the [Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) Capstone Project offered by [Coursera](http://www.coursera.com) in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University.

# What can you find here ?

1. All *.RData consist of reusable R Objects throughout the R Codes.
2. `week2.RMD` is the first report submission for analyzing the Corpus.
3. `week3.R` is the main orchestra for week 3 task; take some patience while going through it as the code might be somewhat messy.
4. All the `week3-*.R` and `week4-*.R` consist of progress code until the final Shiny Application.
5. Content in directory `pitchSlideRpresentation` consist of the code for pitch slides.
